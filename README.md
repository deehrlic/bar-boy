# bar-boy

this repository contains the source code for a remote controlled drink machine that was built by deehrlic and cduval with a raspberry pi

bar-boy's backend has recently been upgraded and now runs on Python with a Flask server directing traffic and uses get requests to communicate between the server and client. This differs from previous builds and allows literally anything with an internet connection running on the same network an ability to easily interface with it since the server and client are no longer dependent on each other.

## Using bar-boy

Assuming you've recreated our hardware build, all you need to do is make sure all devices intended to connect to the bar-boy and run 
```
python3 api.py
```
on your Pi and 
```
python3 client.py
```
if you're using our included client. Since our setup is modeled off of an API, you can interface with bar-boy by sending a get request to 
```
http://pi's-ip-addr:port#/api/route?drink=drink-name
```
to trigger whatever drink you sent to pour. All service to the bar-boy itself is routed through the LOCAL IP address of the Pi running it so take note of that.
